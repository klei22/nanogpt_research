1. create python script to autocreate dataset, with cryptographic level
   randomness
2. run training on said dataset with set number of context (in this case it
   probably doesn't matter all so much, but can try 128 for starters being a
   simple cyclic group or combos of such, can try more later)
3. from the training, create a graph of the loss and accuracy as a function of
   time
4. place these each on a common matplotlib graph and compare
